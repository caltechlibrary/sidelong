Icon sources for sidetrack
==========================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/term/debug/3482208/) of a document with a line break, used as the icon for this repository, was created by [iconixar](https://thenounproject.com/iconixar/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

I edited the logo in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS to change the icon color to the orange used by Caltech in their logo.
